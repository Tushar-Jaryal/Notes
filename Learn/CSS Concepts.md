1. **The CSS Cascade**
	- As the name suggests, Stylesheets cascade (top to bottom).
	- This means that the order of CSS rules matter and when two rules apply that have equal specificity the one that comes last in the CSS is the one that will be used.
2. **Inheritance**
	- Inheritance is the way that CSS properties are passed down from parent to child elements.
	- If a property is not specified on an element, it will inherit the value from its parent.
3. **Display & Positioning**
	- The display property specifies the display behaviour of an element.
	- The six display options are: 
		- block
		- inline
		- list-item
		- table
		- inline-block
		- none
	- The CSS position property sets how an element is position property sets how an element is positioned in a document.
4. **The CSS Box Model**
	- The box model is a way of representing HTML elements as boxes.
	- There are six properties that make up the box model:
		- width
		- height
		- padding
		- borders
		- margin
		- content
5. **Grid Systems**
	- You can use two different grid systems in CSS: Grid and Flexbox
		- Grid systems are a great way to create responsive layouts.
		- By understanding both of these grid systems, you can create layouts that look good on all devices.
6. **Media Queries**
	- Media queries allow you to specify different styles for different screen sizes and devices.
	- You can use them to create layouts that look good on all devices or target specific devices with tailored styles.
7. Specificity
	- As multiple rules apply to an element conflicting rules are sorted and applied by specificity.
	- Each selector has a different specificity ranking which are:
		- Id's
		- Class and Pseudo Class
		- Element selectors
