### JavaScript
- Dynamic Typing: Variables can change types during runtime.
- Loose Typing: No strict type checking, which offers flexibility but can lead to runtime errors.
- Interpreted: Executes code by line, making it accessible across various platforms.
- JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language used to make webpages more interactive.
- JavaScript has no built-in support for type annotations.
- JavaScript has limited tooling support for code analysis and refactoring.
- Code written in JavaScript is compatible with all browsers and environments that support it.
- JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with prototype-based inheritance.
- JavaScript allows variables to be null or undefined.
### TypeScript
- Static Typing: Provides a robust static typing system, catching errors during development.
- Strict Typing: Enforces strong typing rules for increased code reliability.
- Transpiled: Code is converted to JavaScript, supporting backward compatibility with modern ECMAScript features.
- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- TypeScript allows developers to annotate variables & return types with static types.
- TypeScript offers advanced tooling like Visual Studio Code.
- TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, making it compatible with any JavaScript environment.
- TypeScript adds features like classes for object-oriented programming.
- TypeScript provides options to handle null and undefined more rigorously through strict null checks.
