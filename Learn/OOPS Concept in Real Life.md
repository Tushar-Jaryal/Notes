## Object-oriented Programming

**Object** - Instance of Class
**Class** - Blueprint of Object
**Encapsulation** - Protecting our data
**Polymorphism** - Different behaviours in different instances
**Abstraction** - Hiding our irrelevant Data
**Inheritance** - One property of the object is acquiring another property of an object.

1. **Real World Problem Solving**: OOP models real-world entities, making it easier to design scalable, maintainable software. It showcases your ability to think in terms of objects, encapsulation, and reusability.
2. **Core Coding Skills**: Concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction are fundamental in software development. Demonstrating OOP knowledge reflects a strong grasp of coding principles and efficient design.
3. **Industry Relevance**: Many modern tech stacks are built on OOP principles. Proficiency in OOP shows you're ready to work with frameworks and languages that power today's applications.

**Class** - Car
**Data Members** - Common Features - Colour, Weight, Speed, Model
**Method** - Common Functionalities - startcar(), changegear(), slowdown(), brake()
**Object** - BMW

**Encapsulation**
School bags can keep your book, pen, erasers, lunch box so on...

**Polymorphism**
Person in school behave like a student.
Person in shopping mall behave like a customer.
Person in home behave like a son.
Person in bus behave like a passenger.

**Abstraction**
ATM - Check Balance, Deposit Cash, Withdrawal Cash, Print Receipt
Even though it performs a lot of actions it doesn't show us the process. It has hidden its process by showing only the main things like getting inputs and giving the output.

**Inheritance**
Mom and Daughter
Some properties of mom inherits by her daughter.
